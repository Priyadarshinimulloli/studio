## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A vibrant green (#90EE90) to evoke freshness, growth, and the natural quality of the raw materials. A classic 'natural' color, but slightly more modern than pure green.
- Background color: A light, desaturated green (#F0FFF0) that provides a clean and unobtrusive backdrop, so the listed supplies remain most prominent to the user.
- Accent color: A soft yellow-orange (#FFB347) is used for calls to action and highlights, ensuring key interactive elements stand out against the green palette.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans', a humanist sans-serif, balances a modern look with approachability and a touch of warmth. The font should remain clear when displayed in rural contexts.
- Use clear and easily recognizable icons representing different raw material categories.
- A clean and intuitive layout will ensure that vendors and suppliers, possibly using older phones, can easily navigate the application, with high legibility and suitable spacing.
